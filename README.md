# What Posh-Header offers..üí™

#### Get Specfic KeyStroke, ASKS/AsyncKeyStoke 
- Ok, I want to clarify and emphasize, that this is not a key logger
- It looks like a key logger because It uses the same WinApi Function to get the keystroke.
- It doesnt log anything, look for yourself
- I found use in it as normally if you would want to get a keystroke in powershell the whole script interrupted, and stopped, with this method its quick, more reliable, and has many capabilities in what Key you want to see if it was pressed or not

**To use it,** 
`If(ASKS "Key"){code to execute}`
